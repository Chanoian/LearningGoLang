# 🐹 Learning Go

Welcome to my Go playground!  
This repo is where I mess around, break things, and (hopefully) learn Go.  

## 📂 What's inside
- `grpc_server/` → first steps with gRPC in Go  
- `samples/` → random practice projects & experiments  
- `notes.md` → my brain dump while learning  

## 🚀 Run Stuff
Clone it, `cd` into a folder, and run:
```bash
go run main.go
